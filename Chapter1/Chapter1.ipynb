For this problem, we assume that `u` = `1/d`, so that the growth and decay rates cancel each other out in each time period. This crucial simplification simplifies state tabulation since it shrinks the total number of stock price possibilties to `2N+1` options. Thus, we can view state as all possible enumerations of stock price `s` and not realizations of the world (sequence of HTHTH...)."
